# Changelog

All notable changes to teamctl will be documented here. Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- Release pipeline now produces GitHub Release artifacts. v0.1.1 published
  to crates.io but the hand-written cargo-dist workflow ran cross-compile
  on a single Ubuntu runner, so no platform tarballs were ever uploaded.
  Regenerated `release.yml` from `dist generate` (proper job matrix) and
  split crates.io publishing into a sibling `publish-crates.yml`.

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- Rate-limit handling. Every runtime invocation flows through
  `teamctl rl-watch`, which detects rate-limit signatures from the
  runtime's `rate_limit_patterns`, records them in a new `rate_limits`
  table, runs a configurable hook chain (`wait` / `send` / `webhook` /
  `run`), and waits until the limit clears before letting the wrapper
  respawn — replacing the previous 5-second tight retry.
- Per-agent `on_rate_limit:` override and a global `rate_limits.hooks:`
  block with `default_on_hit` chain.
- Runtime descriptor field: `rate_limit_patterns` with optional
  `resets_at_capture` / `resets_in_capture` regexes.
- Docs: `docs/concepts/rate-limits.md`.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-25

### Added

- `team-core` — YAML schema, validator, renderer, `Supervisor` trait with portable `TmuxSupervisor`.
- `team-mcp` — stdio JSON-RPC MCP server with `whoami`, `dm`, `broadcast`, `inbox_peek/ack/watch`, `list_team`, `org_chart`, `request_approval`.
- `teamctl` CLI — `validate`, `up`, `down`, `reload`, `status`, `logs`, `send`, `bridge open/close/list/log`, `pending`, `approve`, `deny`, `budget`, `gc`.
- `team-bot` — Telegram interface adapter with inline approval UI and `--manager` scoping.
- Runtime adapters for Claude Code, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI.
- Project isolation; time-boxed inter-project manager bridges; HITL permission fabric with default sensitive-action list.
- Interfaces abstraction (Telegram, Discord, iMessage, CLI, webhook — Telegram adapter shipped; others documented).
- Astro Starlight docs site scaffold + Cloudflare Pages deploy workflow.
- `cargo-dist` release pipeline, `install.sh`, Homebrew tap config, crates.io publish.
