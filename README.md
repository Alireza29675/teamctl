# teamctl

**docker-compose for persistent AI agent teams.**

Declare a team of long-lived Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI sessions in YAML. Every agent is its own real CLI running in its own `tmux` pane, supervised and auto-respawned (`systemd` and `launchd` backends are on the [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md)). They coordinate through a shared MCP mailbox. Each project has its own private org-chart with one or more managers; you talk to those managers over pluggable **interfaces** (Telegram, Discord, iMessage, CLI, webhook). Brand-sensitive actions pause for your approval.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://teamctl.run/install | sh
cd /path/to/your/project
teamctl init
teamctl up
```

> Prefer to build from source? `cargo install teamctl team-mcp team-bot` works too. A Homebrew tap is on the way — see the [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md).

## Getting started

> **Upgrading from 0.3.x?** See [Migrate from flat layout to `.team/`](https://teamctl.run/cookbook/migrate-to-team-folder/).

teamctl drops a `.team/` folder into your existing project, brings the agents up in `tmux`, and supervises them. Four commands take any repo to a running team:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project    # 1. start in the repo you want a team in
teamctl init                # 2. scaffold .team/ here
teamctl up                  # 3. bring the team up
teamctl reload              # 4. apply edits to .team/team-compose.yaml
```

**1. `cd /path/to/your/project`** — teamctl integrates with an existing project, it doesn't replace it. The agents in your team will work alongside whatever else is in this directory, with their config and state living under a single `.team/` subfolder.

**2. `teamctl init`** writes a `.team/` directory in the current repo with a starter `team-compose.yaml`, role prompts for a manager and a dev, and a `.env.example`. The contents are plain YAML and Markdown — nothing hidden, nothing generated at runtime that you can't read.

**3. `teamctl up`** brings the team up. Each agent gets its own `tmux` pane running its CLI (Claude Code by default), wired to a shared SQLite mailbox over MCP. Runtime state — the database, rendered env files, supervisor records — lives in `.team/state/`, gitignored.

**4. `teamctl reload`** picks up edits to `.team/team-compose.yaml` and restarts only the agents whose config actually changed. No full teardown, no lost mailbox state.

**Talking to the team.** Copy `.team/.env.example` to `.team/.env`, fill in `TEAMCTL_TELEGRAM_TOKEN` and `TEAMCTL_TELEGRAM_CHATS`, and the manager bot will introduce itself when you DM it on Telegram. Brand-sensitive actions (`publish`, `deploy`, `release`, …) pause for inline Approve / Deny.

The full onboarding tutorial lives at [teamctl.run/getting-started](https://teamctl.run/getting-started/); curated example teams (`startup-team`, `oss-maintainer`, `indie-game-studio`, `newsletter-office`, `market-analysts`) ship under [`examples/`](https://github.com/Alireza29675/teamctl/tree/main/examples).

## What's in a team

- **Every node is a separate long-lived CLI** — Claude Code, Codex, or Gemini — running in its own `tmux` pane. No shared process, no "roles inside one LLM."
- **Projects are self-contained org charts.** One project can have many managers and many workers; workers are wired to one or more managers through `reports_to`. Agents can call `org_chart` to introspect their chain of command.
- **Managers talk to each other** inside a project (shared `#leads` channel or DM). Across projects they're isolated — a one-off **bridge** opens a manager-to-manager link for a limited time.
- **You reach managers through any of the configured interfaces.** Telegram is the first adapter; Discord, iMessage, CLI, and webhooks plug in the same way.
- **Brand-sensitive actions pause.** Tool calls tagged `publish`, `release`, `deploy`, `payment`, … block on `request_approval` and surface on your chosen interface with Approve / Deny.

## Status

Early but moving fast. v0.4.0 is the latest release (April 2026); MIT-licensed, working, and shipped in the open. See the [ROADMAP](./ROADMAP.md) and [CHANGELOG](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full picture.

## What you get

- Persistent Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI sessions in `tmux`, supervised and auto-respawned
- Real-time DMs, channels, and a per-agent inbox (SQLite-backed)
- MCP `notifications/claude/channel` events so Claude Code agents wake on new mail without polling
- `reply_to_user` so managers can talk back through the configured interface (Telegram today)
- Multi-project isolation with opt-in, time-boxed manager bridges
- Human-in-the-loop approvals for brand-sensitive actions, surfaced on Telegram with inline Approve/Deny
- Per-runtime rate-limit detection with a configurable hook chain (`wait` / `send` / `webhook` / `run`)
- Declarative YAML — change it, run `teamctl reload`, zero downtime
- A growing inspection toolbox: `teamctl ps / mail / tail / inspect / attach / exec / shell`

## How it compares

The space of "process-level supervisors of CLI coding agents" is busy, and the comparison most readers want is to other neighbors. The table below is a feature matrix, not a leaderboard — every row in this neighborhood does something well that teamctl doesn't, and vice versa.

| Feature                              | teamctl | claude-squad | claude-flow | mcp_agent_mail | raw `tmux + scripts` |
|--------------------------------------|:-------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:--------------:|:--------------------:|
| Declarative team file (YAML)         |   ✅   |      —       |      —      |       —        |          —           |
| Org charts as code (`reports_to`)    |   ✅   |      —       |      —      |       —        |          —           |
| Multi-runtime out of the box (Claude Code · Codex · Gemini) | ✅ | partial | Claude-only | n/a | DIY |
| Persistent agents across reboots     |   ✅   |   partial    |   partial   |     n/a        |         DIY          |
| Mailbox bundled with the supervisor  |   ✅   |      —       |      —      |   ✅ (alone)   |          —           |
| Inter-agent DMs + channels           |   ✅   |      —       |   partial   |      ✅        |         DIY          |
| Project isolation + opt-in bridges   |   ✅   |      —       |      —      |       —        |          —           |
| Telegram (or other) approval inbox (HITL) | ✅ |      —       |      —      |       —        |          —           |
| Service-grade supervision (tmux today; systemd · launchd planned) | ✅ | tmux | tmux | n/a | tmux |
| Single static binary, no runtime deps |   ✅   |      —       |      —      |       —        |         n/a          |

A few honest notes on the table:

- **claude-squad** is excellent at the "multiple sessions for one operator" job. It isn't trying to be a team framework, and that's fine.
- **claude-flow** is the largest project in the neighborhood and goes deep on swarms + neural patterns inside Claude. teamctl is narrower: persistent declarative teams, runtime-agnostic.
- **mcp_agent_mail** is an unbundled mailbox you wire into other tools. teamctl bundles a mailbox with the supervisor + interfaces — different layer, complementary problem.
- **`tmux + scripts`** is the honest baseline. If you'd rather hand-roll a wrapper script and a `mailbox.sh`, you can. teamctl is what happens after you've done that twice.
